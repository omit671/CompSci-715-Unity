1,"Difficult to navigate through due to complex tour where the same room is reused to go to different rooms? I would get confused which portal in a room led where. Perhaps going through the tour slower would have helped.",3,2,"Was difficult to navigate as after a few rooms the audio felt very overwhelming and started contributing to the motion sick feeling. This felt more immersive but had the same level of difficulty in navigating due to me getting confused which portal in the room led to which route. This museum also felt bigger so got lost more easily.",4,2,"The second one felt more realistic due to sound but the audio was a bit overwhelming and felt disorientating at times. So I would say I prefer the first museum as it was less disorientating - it also felt smaller?",Yes,"Maybe going through the tour slower would have helped in the beginning. Seeing a map or similar would also have helped explain where rooms led to. The sound should perhaps be reduced a bit as it made it feel more sickening at times. The audio in the second museum almost made navigation worse as I expected the sound to only start when I entered the portal"
2,"No i felt it was okay to navigate through. It was pretty intuitive i want to say",4,3,"There was one section where entering a room through a door and exiting that same door puts you in a different room so that was interesting",4,4,"2",No,"Maybe add more sounds to help navigate the first museum"
3,"Didn't have a very strong map, only vague ideas of where in the journey it was around. Most of it was trial and error",5,4,"I was a bit better trained this time and also had a slightly stronger mental map. Also the sounds may have helped",5,5,"Second one",No,"Less annoying sounds (though they did kinda help)"
4,"It wasn't too bad I got more familiar with certain rooms. I struggled to find the cave room as I wasn't as familiar with it.",4,3,"I feel like I struggled with the second more. Not 100% sure why. It felt like there were more closer loops where you could get stuck in the sane 3 rooms.",4,3,"I liked that the second museum had larger rooms with more interesting locations.",No,"Having interactive objects in the rooms could make them more interesting and memorable as you form greater connections with them. This would require allowing us to use the controllers."
5,"A little as some of the rooms looked very similar (apart from the colour, or objects that can not be seen through the portal)",3,2,"No, it felt more connected than the first",5,4,"2nd. Mainly because it felt more alive, as if it was an actual museum connected as opposed to a collection of disconnected rooms.",No,"Things felt like they popped through the portals, such as the resolution and sounds in museum 1. This made them feel less connected."
6,"No. Because while I go through the first museum, I have no idea what should I do.",5,4,"Yes, because I try to remember everything, however I can't and I get lost.",5,4,"First museum, because it has a doggy.",Yes,"Play some nice bgm."
7,"It was okey",5,1,"Yes, I got lost between 3 rooms (the baby room pie one of them)",5,1,"The second one as I liked the art there more",No,"The spring is scary"
8,"Yes, because I lost direction",4,4,"Yes, because I lost direction",3,3,"First, more realistic ",No,""
9,"Yes, because i didn�t know the rule at the beginning. ",3,4,"Yes, I guess too many rooms are there. ",2,4,"I prefer the first one, because first one I didn�t get lost. ",Yes,"No, I think the overall is good"
11,"",5,3,"",2,4,"The room with the racing cars is very real",No,""
10,"Yes, It's hard to remember the room I walked through.",4,4,"No, because it is easier to remember.",4,4,"The second, there are more rooms.",No,"Give me a map."
12,"Yes because it was difficult to remember which rooms connected",4,3,"Yes it felt like there were more rooms",4,4,"2nd museum",No,"More different coloured walls"
13,"Yes, moving through portals made it difficult to remember what room was where. ",3,2,"Not so much, I don�t know why. ",2,2,"Neither. I liked both equally. But maybe the first since the first museum was my first experience of the portal environment in VR. ",Yes,"At the very end of each museum when the goal chime occurs at the end upon reaching the original starting room the environment moves in the headset when I wasn�t moving. This made me feel slightly sick at the end of each experience. To improve navigation, a virtual map that I could look at would help in understanding the layout."
15,"A little bit but only because my memory was bad and I kept forgetting how things connected together ",4,3,"I found it easier but mainly because I had a better idea of what was expected of me and what to look out for ",5,4,"I liked the second one because it had a dinosaur. But legitimately I preferred the second museum because I had more of an understanding of what was going on and so was able to remember more and find more efficient routes",No,"There are some rooms that didn�t really have any defining features which didn�t really help. Also there were other people in the room which meant that I couldn�t talk out loud to remember things as well as I would have liked to help me remember"
18,"It was a bit hard to find my way, the visuals and audio was a little overwhelming",4,4,"Not really, it was much the same experience as the precious one - I think the challenge was mitigated by the level of experience that I was  ",5,5,"The baby exhibit, it was excruciating ",No,"Make the audio and visual cues more distinct"
16,"Yes. I had forgotten a lot of the layout. By the second round, I didn�t even remember a �rain� room. As I did more I understood the layout a bit better. I mostly judged it on the rooms I had been in most recently. ",4,2,"Yes, but somewhat less. Once again, I forgot a room, I forgot about the �mine� room. I lost track of the rooms fairly quickly, it was a lot of peaking through doors. Rooms with more than 2 doors were very confusing but I could usually remember the ones with only 2 doors. ",4,2,"The second because I felt like it had more memorable objects and they became more clear landmarks. ",No,"If the walls weren�t just a blank colour. If they were actually textured I might associate it more with the objects inside, and be able to tell by looking through the doors easier."
17,"No it wasn�t too bad on the rooms that only had two connections or lots of distinctive stuff but for the rooms that didn�t have many items or had another room that looked similar it become a lot more difficult. ",4,2,"No it was ok. But definitely more challenging than the last since there was more rooms that were more complex with more doors however the audio queues helped me realise where I was better. Also the rooms with more stuff made it easier to remember ",4,1,"The first because the museum rooms are more different than a normal set of rooms and did feel like actually exploring a museum while the first felt like a home. ",No,"Maybe to standardise the memory stage have that as more guides or with locked doors initially but I would change it so that the rooms have more memorable details like changing the floor materials or providing more detailed environments"
19,"Not difficult, the navigations are easy to follow ",5,4,"A little bit more, because there are more doors in each room",5,4,"Second one is more interesting, because the theme of the senses are better",Yes,"Maybe change the door place in different rooms will be better."
20,"No arrows pointed the way",5,4,"More difficult than the first one, not sure why. Felt like more rooms? ",5,5,"Second, it felt creepier and had things that moved ",No,""
21,"Yes, well most rooms are identical ",3,3,"No, I remembered the patterns ",4,3,"Second",Yes,"There were too many turning points, it makes me feel dizzy."
22,"I found it difficult at points. I could remember certain paths that I had just been on but as soon it was easy to forget where I was and once I was lost it was very tricky to get back",5,4,"I didn't find it much different to the first one. It was much easier to go along the path that was shown in the tour. I would try and do what I remembered from that path but I would forget occasionally and just wander around until I reached either the goal or something I recognized from the tour path. I don't know if I got lost more or less this museum it felt like I did about the same",5,4,"I liked the first one more because it had video game and meme references. They felt the reasonably similar in most other ways. The big rooms were cool",No,"A map would obviously help but I'm not sure if anything less than that would be helpful"
23,"Sometimes because there were many doors in one place, and being able to access it from both sides of the door was a little confusing.",4,3,"Yes! It felt less structured than the other one, I felt I couldn't retrace my steps as easily. ",4,3,"The first one.",Yes,"Signs"
24,"No, each room was distinct so I remembered the order easily.",4,3,"A bit more difficult, i feel like its because the environments were more complex.",3,2,"The second museum, harder to navigate byt more interesting.",No,"No I had fun."
25,"No",3,3,"No",3,3,"",No,""
26,"Not too difficult, I was able to retrace my steps from when I did the tour.",4,3,"Less difficult than the first, because it was pretty much the same layout as the first, and I was getting the hang of it.",4,3,"The second one, I found it easier, and I liked the dinosaur ",No,""
27,"It was difficult to navigate at first because i didnt remember the rooms but once ive got the hang of walking around, ive managed to remember the rooms",4,3,"It was easier than the first museum, i suppose the audio helped a lot with associating the rooms and navigation ",5,4,"Second one, nice and much bigger rooms, also the audio made it more fun - very therapeutic ",No,"make it longer pls it was fun!!"
28,"I found it fairly difficult to navigate, but this was at least partly because the environment was unfamiliar (and I would probably find it difficult to navigate even if there were no portals). ",4,3,"I also found this museum quite difficult to navigate, but again I believe this was partly due to the fact that the environment being unfamiliar. Additionally, from the first museum, I had already used a lot of my brainpower adjusting to this environment, I believe I experienced some kind of mental fatigue in the second room.",4,4,"I preferred the second museum, as the rooms seemed to be more linked together and (if my memory serves me correctly) there were more open, spacious rooms.",No,"Not really! I think it could be interesting to provide some kind of map, but it would probably be quite difficult to make due to the non-Euclidean structure of the space."
29,"No. It was just a little struggle to remember which rooms lead to what rooms ",4,3,"No it seemed easier in the second museum. I could hear the sounds between rooms better",4,5,"The second ? ",No,"Signs telling you the quickest route to the room your looking for"
30,"A little. Some of the room items were hard to remember. I also didn�t give myself long enough to study the room. ",4,1,"Yes more portals meant more options. ",4,2,"The second one. More to look at and a good brain challenge. ",No,"No - I think it is down to the persons observation and giving themselves time to explore things"
31,"A little, because it is a little hard to remember the connection relationships between rooms ",5,4,"Easier than the first one, because there are more moving objects makes it easier to navigate specific room",5,5,"Museum 2, sounds hears more realistic and moving objects makes it more immersive ",No,""
